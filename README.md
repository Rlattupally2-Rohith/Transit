# Transit
Calculates the number of stops required to get to your preferred destination
There are 3 methods of getting to your stop which includes taking a train, bus, and then walking to your destination
The unit of measurement is in blocks. 
Say you are currently on block 5 but you need to get to block 12. Though the train might not take you all the way to block 12 and neither will the bus.
So this program will essentially get you the most efficent route to your house without having to walk too much.
